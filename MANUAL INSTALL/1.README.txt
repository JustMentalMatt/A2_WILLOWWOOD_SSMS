Manually running the program is not reccomended, however it is possible for users with advanced
technical knowledge.

To manually install the program, its libraries must be installed first.

1. Move the "Install Libraries.bat" and requirements.txt to the root directory 
   (outside of this folder)
2. Execute the .bat file and libraries will install.
3. Run the IDLE version of the main.py file.

Alternatively, execute the "pip install -r requirements.txt" command from the root directory.
^^^ This is a substitute for the .bat file, the requirements.txt file must still be moved to the
root folder.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If running the software from a code or text editor: VSCODE, VisualStudio, PyCharm .etc
open the root folder as a new project - don't simply open the main.py file as it won't be
able to access any other files.

- If using this method, run the "main.py" file, NOT the IDLE one. This is due to the non-IDLE
	file running from the root folder, as it is opened from a code-editor, however the IDLE
	version has its root directory changed from within the frontend folder, to the root folder.
